        <ul>
          <li><strong>Tiered Options:</strong> Flexible levels to fit your clinic’s needs and budget.</li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>Predictive Reliability:</strong> Track door performance and replace critical parts before they fail, minimizing downtime.</li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>Superior Safety & Efficiency:</strong> Simple, long-term solutions that reduce future maintenance costs and prevent operational errors.</li>
          <br>
