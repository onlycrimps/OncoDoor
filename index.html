            <h4>Partial Repairs</h4>
            <p>It is common to see unfinished repairs. In the moment it can feel like a victory, but this opens the door to risk of larger failures.</p>

            <h4>Hidden Damage</h4>
            <p>Some outside factors such as roof leaks can lead to damage of rail systems, electronics, and the operator. Scheduled PM's catch these early to avoid costly replacements.</p>

            <h4>Early Model Controllers</h4>
            <p>Older controllers that are maintained, work well. Our Machine Health monitoring and custom sollutions can keep these running for the life of your door.</p>
