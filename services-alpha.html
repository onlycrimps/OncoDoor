      <h2>Why Preventative Maintenance Matters</h2>
      <p>Regular maintenance isn’t just about avoiding breakdowns — it’s about protecting your investment, catching hidden issues early, and ensuring reliable operation for years to come.</p>

          <h3>Partial Repairs</h3>
          <p>It’s common to see repairs that only solve the immediate problem. While this may feel like a win in the moment, leaving related components unchecked often leads to bigger failures later — and higher costs.</p>

          <h3>Hidden Damage</h3>
          <p>Outside factors like roof leaks can damage rail systems, electronics, and operators. Scheduled maintenance helps us catch these early, preventing costly replacements and avoiding extended downtime.</p>

          <h3>Early Model Controllers</h3>
          <p>Older controllers can still perform reliably — if maintained properly. Our machine health monitoring and custom solutions extend their life, keeping your doors running for years to come.</p>
